## Advising History

I have been fortunate enough to have built a relationship with Professor Miriam Posner since my time as an undergraduate student at UCLA. I sought her guidance when considering the Digital Humanities minor and also when I was initially deciding to apply for the Information Studies graduate program. Seeking her counseling again as she transitioned to the Information Studies Department faculty, I have met with her consistently each quarter to discuss my progress both academically and professionally.

During my second quarter in the program, I enrolled in Professor Posner’s Digital Humanities 201 course in pursuit of the Digital Humanities graduate certificate. This course was engaging and enriching, as I challenged myself to undertaking a project that tested my own technical limitations. Professor Posner’s collaborative and critical pedagogical style allowed me to explore this potential to improve and fail, if need be. She was supportive throughout, connecting me to the people and resources on campus that could help me succeed. During this time, I met with Dave Shepard at UCLA’s Humtech to dive deeper into Natural Language Processing.

Professor Posner was supportive in providing me with resources for jobs when I was searching for more experience. Her advice also helped me prioritize my own well-being when undertaking too much at once.

In lieu of the exciting arrival of Professor Posner’s newborn (endless congrats!), I was able to meet with Professor Johanna Drucker. Entering into the program, I have continually sought the academic and professional guidance of Professor Drucker. I have worked with her as a GSR archival assistant at the Venice poetry space Beyond Baroque and have taken several formative classes with her.

I am assured that these professional relationships will aide me in my future professional development and practices, and my own pursuit of life-long learning. It also serves as a personal reminder of the importance of supporting and advocating for younger professionals.

I am also grateful for those who guided me and took the time to offer counseling during my time in the program, including Michelle Caswell, Kathy Carbone, Courtney Dean, Lori Dedeyan, Eunsong Kim, Mario Ramirez, Danny Snelson, Shawn VanCour, and more. I would also like to thank everyone in my cohort, and both the previous and successive cohorts, who supported me and shared their own experiences the past two years.
