This paper seeks to outline the complicated ownership issues that exist in Caribbean collections as a result of colonial history and its present formations. As climate change creates ruptures in the archival record, by the reinstatement of neocolonial control or by disaster’s effects, it is crucial to view these ruptures as part and parcel of same project, the accumulation and extraction of the Earth’s resources in order to support the unequal balance of globalized capitalism. I argue that the issue of custody and community ownership of records in the postcolonial context is more crucial than appeals to conservation, which can be used to conceal and further neocolonial control and displacement of community memory.
