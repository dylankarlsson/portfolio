## Outside Agents: Co-Appraisal and the Capacity for Multiplicities in the Participatory Archive

[A full-text PDF of the paper is available here.](MajorPaper_Karlsson.pdf)

In this paper, I outline the foundations of the participatory approach to appraisal and address the potential breakthroughs and challenges that may face such models in the future. Acknowledging the contingency upon which “participation” in the archives can be consented to or coerced, my focus lies on the pluralistic landscape of archival repositories in the United States, particularly in universities and large cultural institutions concerned with education. It is through the discussion of the participatory model’s concrete barriers and speculative dimensions that I argue for its implementation, through a diversity of methods and with varying scopes particular to each institution. In focus here is transparent, open-source documentation, participatory collecting drives, and cross-institutional projects and partnerships, among other strategies. Key to the participatory framework, and why it is a desirable strategy, is not only the distribution of resources in creating and preserving historical memory, and therefore agency, but also as a means of recognizing the alternative forms of archival agencies already active within the archival repertoires of underrepresented communities.

This paper seeks to outline the complicated ownership issues that exist in Caribbean collections as a result of colonial history and its present formations. As climate change creates ruptures in the archival record, by the reinstatement of neocolonial control or by disaster’s effects, it is crucial to view these ruptures as part and parcel of same project, the accumulation and extraction of the Earth’s resources in order to support the unequal balance of globalized capitalism. I argue that the issue of custody and community ownership of records in the postcolonial context is more crucial than appeals to conservation, which can be used to conceal and further neocolonial control and displacement of community memory.
