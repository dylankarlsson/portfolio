  <p>I am an archivist, digital librarian, poet, and student.</p>

  <p>I am currently an MLIS candidate for the Information Studies Department at the University of California, Los Angeles. This past year, I have worked as an Assistant Community Archivist with <a href="https://vcmedia.org/" target="_blank">Visual Communications</a> in Little Tokyo, as an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Fellow for the <a href="https://communityarchiveslab.ucla.edu/" target="blank">Community Archives Lab</a>.</p>

  <p>I have experience working at community archives, university archives, digital libraries, natural history museums, and herbaria.</p>
