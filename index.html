  <p>I am an archivist, digital librarian, poet, and student.</p>

  <p>I am currently an MLIS candidate for the Information Studies Department at the University of California, Los Angeles. This past year, I have worked as an Assistant Community Archivist with <a href="https://vcmedia.org/" target="_blank">Visual Communications</a> in Little Tokyo, as an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Fellow for the <a href="https://communityarchiveslab.ucla.edu/" target="blank">Community Archives Lab</a>.</p>

  <p>I have experience working at community archives, university archives, digital libraries, natural history museums, and herbaria.</p>

<p><h5><br>UCLA is a land grant institution. As a student of this university and local resident, I acknowledge and pay my respects to the Tongva peoples as the traditional land caretakers of <a href="https://www.aisc.ucla.edu/sounds/world.wav">Tovaangar</a> (Los Angeles basin, So. Channel Islands).
<br><br>This territory acknowledgement and accompanying pronunciation has been adapted from and is attributed to <a href="https://www.wacd.ucla.edu/" title="">the UCLA World Arts and Cultures/Dance Department</a>.</h5><p>
