<h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
<br>
<p>This portfolio was designed according to many of the accessibility qualifications as outlined in <a href="http://ncdae.org/resources/factsheets/principles.php" title="">National Center on Disability and Access to Education’s Principles of Accessible Design</a>. The contents of the portfolio are designed to be navigated freely with no required order. </p>
<br>
<p>Formatting content for readability, I opted for a minimal design that prioritizes text over embedded media. The Jekyll theme Ed is used because it was designed with accessibility in mind, as an open-source, open access theme for minimal computing. With my iteration of this Jekyll theme, I aim to maintain its legible and durable textual and graphic display. This theme can be rendered flexibly across different device browsers.</p>
<br>
<p>All images are formatted with alt-text to assist users with visual impairments in accessing all facets of hosted media, and contents are not dependent on color to be rendered legible.
Where applicable, HTML headers are employed to organize the content embedded within the webpage, and assist users navigating with a keyboard. Using the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" title="">WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a> developed by <a href="https://webaim.org/" title="">WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind)</a>, I evaluated the accessibility of my website and its contents.</p>
<br>
<p>I decided to use Github Pages as a platform because it is a free tool with open-source integration. It has been widely used and is supported by a large community of users and professionals.</p>
<br>
<p>Due to the recent COVID-19 crisis, there is no accessible print version of the portfolio made available. The contents of the portfolio are accessible in a print PDF format, which are available for download within this website. To ensure the preservation and management of this content, I will maintain digital copies of these documents, as well as a backup of the Github repository contents. Rendered as a living document, future changes made within the website’s design or content are subject to the evolving standards described in this statement.</p>
